**KaliGPT** is crafted by **Krishna Dwivedi (SudoHopeX)**, an ethical hacker and open-source enthusiast, with a vision to revolutionize how security professionals interact with AI. 
Fueled by personal intuition and hands-on experience in offensive security, he built KaliGPT to unify powerful AI models - `Gemini`, `Llama`, `Mistral`, and `ChatGPT` into a single, seamless *CLI tool for Linux*. 


Designed for ethical hackers, OSINT investigators, penetration testers, and Learners in CLI (Command Line Interface). 


Currently, the developer is advancing the project toward `HackerX (KaliGPT v1.3)` - a next-gen evolution introducing *Tool calling support*, *online search with crawling support*, *Pretty print*, *optimized configuration management* to make AI-driven security workflows smarter, faster, and accessible to all. 


This project stands as a beacon of ethical innovation - `Built for Hackers, by a emerging Hacker`.
